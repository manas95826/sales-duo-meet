[00:00] Ananya Sharma: Hi everyone, can you all hear me clearly?

[00:03] Ritesh Mehta: Yep, loud and clear.

[00:04] Sneha Kulkarni: Yes, we can hear you.

[00:06] Ananya Sharma: Great. Let’s quickly get started then. So the agenda today is to finalize the Q3 product roadmap and get updates from each team. We'll begin with the engineering team. Ritesh?

[00:17] Ritesh Mehta: Sure. So on the dev front, the backend for the analytics module is 90% done. We're planning to push it to staging by Friday. The frontend team is currently integrating the dashboard widgets.

[00:28] Ananya Sharma: Awesome. Any blockers?

[00:30] Ritesh Mehta: Nothing major. There’s a minor API latency issue but we’re working with DevOps on that.

[00:35] Ananya Sharma: Perfect. Sneha, any updates from marketing?

[00:37] Sneha Kulkarni: Yes, we’ve finalized the launch campaign creatives. We’ll start A/B testing the landing pages next week. Also, influencer outreach has started — we’ve onboarded 4 new creators this week.

[00:48] Ananya Sharma: That’s good progress. Make sure we track engagement metrics closely.

[00:52] Sneha Kulkarni: Will do.

[00:53] Ananya Sharma: Alright. Product side — Kunal couldn’t join today but he’s sent over the updated specs. I’ll share those in the chat now.

[01:01] Ananya Sharma: (posts link) Please review these before EOD so we can send them to the dev team.

[01:06] Ritesh Mehta: Got it.

[01:07] Sneha Kulkarni: On it.

[01:09] Ananya Sharma: Any other updates or concerns?

[01:11] Ritesh Mehta: Just one thing — can we move the Friday sync to 4 PM instead of 3 PM?

[01:14] Ananya Sharma: Works for me. Sneha?

[01:15] Sneha Kulkarni: Fine by me too.

[01:17] Ananya Sharma: Cool, I’ll update the calendar. If there’s nothing else, let’s wrap this up. Thanks everyone!

[01:21] Ritesh Mehta: Thanks!

[01:21] Sneha Kulkarni: Thank you!

[01:22] Meeting ended.
